# Recipe-App

The Recipe App is a user-friendly Android application designed to help users discover, manage, and save recipes efficiently. Built using Java in Android Studio, the app allows users to browse recipes by category, search by dish name or ingredients, and view detailed instructions with images. It supports multiple user roles: Admins and Chefs can add, edit, and delete recipes, while regular Users can browse and save their favorite dishes. Recipes are stored locally using SQLite, and the app also integrates the Meal API for online recipe searches. With a clean interface and role-based access, the app offers a personalized and organized cooking experience for everyone from casual home cooks to professional chefs.
